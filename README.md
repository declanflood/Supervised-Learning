# Finding Donors - Supervised Learning Project

This project employed several supervised algorithms to solve a binary classification problem.

The data was collected from the 1994 US Census. It contains attributes of 45,000 individuals, and is labelled to indicate whether that individual earns more than 50,000 USD. A fictitious charity believes individuals earning over this threshold are more likely to make a donation. The objective of the project is build a model to predict this based on an individual's attributes.

Three candidate algorithms were tested: a Support Vector Classifier, a K Nearest Neighbour Classifier and a Random Forest Classifier. The latter was found to have the best performance and was further tuned.
